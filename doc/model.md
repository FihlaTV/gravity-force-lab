Model Notes
===========

The underlying model for gravitational forces between two masses depicted in this simulation is Newton's law of Gravitation.
Please see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation for more information on this.

The simulation portrays how the gravitational force changes when masses are changed or the distance between them changes.
