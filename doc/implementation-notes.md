This sim is the translation from existing java simulation. Initial development on the simulation is done by MLL.

In the further development of this Sim feature of constant radius is added and color of the mass is changed to show how
density will vary and fow low mass it looks almost airy.

The mass out here varies from 1 KG to 1000KG and model deals with all the distances in meter. The center in the model
co-ordiantes is between the masses
